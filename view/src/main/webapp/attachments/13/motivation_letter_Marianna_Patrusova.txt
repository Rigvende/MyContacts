“Why I want to become a Syberry Academy student”

Hello. My name is Marianna Patrusova. 
I am a beginner Java developer. 
Previously, I graduated from the Academy of Management with a degree in economics and management. However, after working for some time in this specialty, I realized that the area is not quite suitable for me. When the question arose about what I want to do in life, I analyzed my strengths and weaknesses, my interests and hobbies, and realized that I had been interested in computers and information technologies all my life. It used to be (and now too, let's be realistic) that these are hobbies for boys. Nevertheless, the world is changing and yes, with age comes the confidence that an adult can decide for himself what to do in life without looking at someone else's opinion. 
I always had language skills. Almost every day I read books and constantly strive to learn something new (unfortunately, this was not in demand at previous places of work). Plus I have a logical mindset. 
Some of my friends entered BSUIR and I was interested to hear about what they were learning, to disassemble the system unit with them, or to see how they soldered simple circuits. Now I myself am studying at BSUIR with a degree in software engineering. Additionally, I graduated from Java courses (and I can write another long text how deeply I love this language). 
So I hope that soon my dream will come true and I will become a real programmer. 
And I am very glad if your advanced professional company can help this. I've heard a lot that for people looking for professional growth, this is the best place to work (especially as a team). The company has well-established processes and practice individual approach to each employee. Plus all people speak about "unforgettable atmosphere".
Thank you for such a great opportunity as Syberry Academy courses to learn something new and get a chance to work in a nice modern company!
